Implementing RSA implementaton optimized
thanks tom lib.
But text to Digit Conversion is not Optimized but Oprimized Conversion can be char* to long long int* casting then convert that number to String
Value got from RSA encryption the result is not optimized it can be done through convert "000"-"255"( which is 3 char ) in one byte (means 1 char).
